# 3D-structure-coloring
Methods and data files to color RNA 3D structures

The structures that are able to be colored are listed in the folder csv_files.  Download one of those structures from PDB (in either CIF or PDB format) and open it with PyMol.  Download the program RNA_coloring_pymol.py from this repository and save in a place where you can find it.  In the PyMol terminal window, at the PyMol> prompt, change directory to where you saved the program RNA_coloring_pymol.py (use "pwd" to find the current directory and "cd .." to move up one directory and "cd newdirectory" to move into a subdirectory).  Then type "run RNA_coloring_pymol.py" to run the program.
